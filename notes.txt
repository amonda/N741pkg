N741 package with templates

1. Create Github repo - N741pkg
2. Create new R proj - using version control w/Git linked to N741pkg repo

For creating a basic package with a template, see Chester Ismay, http://ismayc.github.io/ecots2k16/template_pkg/

also see Karl Broman, http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/
and Jenny Bryan, http://stat545.com/packages00_index.html and  http://stat545.com/hw08_2014_package.html

3. Make sure devtools package is installed, update if needed
4. load devtools; library(devtools)


5. since I already created the project and the folder and added git, let's try devtools::setup()
6. it worked - asked if I wanted to update .Rproj, I said yes.
7. saved and sync with Github
